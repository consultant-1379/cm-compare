  <ns1:desc>This enumaration contains the following values:

Always = Data replication is always performed. This overrides the characteristics set on the each container ( that is associated with the RPU ).

Never = Data replication is never performed. This overrides the characteristics set on the each container ( that is associated with the RPU ).

AtShutdown = Each time the RSH (which handles the RPU) is shut down, a complete snapshot is taken and replicated to the other MP, if necessary. Otherwise, the replication is performed according to the characteristics set on each container ( that is associated with the RPU ).

ApplControlled = The data replication is made according to the characteristics set on each container ( that is associated with the RPU ). This is the default value.</ns1:desc>
