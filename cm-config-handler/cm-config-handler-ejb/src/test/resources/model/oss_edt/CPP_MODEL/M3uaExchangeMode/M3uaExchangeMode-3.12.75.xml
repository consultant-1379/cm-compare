  <ns1:desc>The IPSP exchange mode.

Specifies the modes of exchanging ASP Traffic Maintenance (ASPTM) and ASP State Maintenance (ASPSM) messages during the negotiation of an IPSP pair.

Each exchange of ASPTM or ASPSM messages can be initiated by any side of the pair.</ns1:desc>
  <ns2:member ns1:lifeCycle="CURRENT" ns1:name="NOT_APPLICABLE" value="0">
    <ns1:desc>This value must be used for ASP and SGP configurations, since exchange modes are relevant only for IPSP configurations.</ns1:desc>
  </ns2:member>
  <ns2:member ns1:lifeCycle="CURRENT" ns1:name="SINGLE_EXCHANGE" value="1">
    <ns1:desc>A single exchange of ASPTM and ASPSM messages is needed to change the IPSP states. This means that one set of requests from one side, acknowledged by the other side, is enough. Therefore, after a single successful exchange, both directions are available for traffic.</ns1:desc>
  </ns2:member>
  <ns2:member ns1:lifeCycle="CURRENT" ns1:name="DOUBLE_EXCHANGE" value="2">
    <ns1:desc>A double exchange of ASPTM and ASPSM messages is needed to change the IPSP states. The management of the connection in the two directions is independent. Therefore, after the first successful exchange, one direction is available for traffic. After the second successful exchange, both directions are available for traffic.</ns1:desc>
